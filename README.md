# Portfolio

A selection of projects intended to demonstrate a variety of coding accomplishments

## Roguelike Prototype

A semi-procedural roguelike ARPG and one of my longest running hobby projects.  Built in LÃ–VE 0.10.1, this project reprsents a wide variety of coding efforts on my part including A* pathfinding by enemies, Dijkstra's algorithm for connecting generated rooms, a generic/reusable system for applying modifiers to entities, utilizing pixel data as a file format for level layouts, an input system, and more.

I have been able to re-use the core "engine" of this project for multiple other hobby projects, greatly improving prototyping time.

## Dimensional Platformer Prototype

A project using the basic framework established in my Roguelike Prototype, but converted to a sidescrolling platformer.  Not nearly as much time has gone into this project, but basic gameplay functionality is present and demonstrates the ease of converting my core "engine" to other projects.
